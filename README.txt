Smart clipboard is an Opera extension.

Did you ever accidentally overwrite stuff in your clipboard, which you needed again afterwards?

Well it did happen to me a lot of times. But that's over now.

Smart Clipboard adds a history to your clipboard. So if you need an older entry just go ahead, open the menu and get it back :)
